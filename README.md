# universal-api-gateway-generator-that-reads

Idea prompt: Universal API gateway generator that reads any combination of REST, GraphQL, gRPC, and WebSocket API definitions and produces a unified gateway with rate limiting per endpoint, JWT validation with RBAC, request/response transformation, API versioning, circuit breakers, caching with invalidation strategies, request coalescing, schema stitching for GraphQL, and auto-generated SDKs in TypeScript, Python, Go, Rust, Swift, and Kotlin.

## Context
Must handle 100k+ RPS, support canary deployments, and include built-in A/B testing for API responses.
